# Privacy Policy


**Svalinn does not collect your data, period.** That's right. Everything entered into Svalinn stays locally on the device it was entered on. This means there are no servers to store any data from Svalinn, so if you wanted to ask for all of your stored data, there would be nothing to show. Svalinn cannot sell your data because there is no data that even leaves your device. That's it. That's the privacy policy.
